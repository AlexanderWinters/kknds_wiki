# OpenWRT
## Installing

Best place to start is the [firmware selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/). You can pick your platform,
version, and also add all the packages you might need together with the base packages, eg, ethernet drivers.

### x86_64
OpenWRT has to be directly installed to a drive from another computer. Download the x86 version OpenWRT. Unzip the image:

```plaintext
gunzip openwrt_2352.img.gz
```

I formatted the disk to exFAT, and then:

```plaintext
dd if=openwrt_2352.img bs=1M of=/dev/sdX
```

Remember to check `lsblk` to see which drive to write.

Then install the hard drive to the other computer. Boot it up and make sure it boots in UEFI, and secure boot is off. It should just boot into OpenWRT now.

###  VM (QEMU)

You need to download any x86\_64 image. I'm using virt-manager as frontend. Make sure when starting the VM to select “Import existing disk image”.

When starting the VM, you need to change the ip address. Note down the subnet of the host's interface that QEMU is using (probably something like `virbr0`)

In this example, I assume that the LAN interface on the VM is br-lan and that the host's subnet is 192.168.122.0/24.

```plaintext
IN OPENWRT
----------
ifconfig # confirm the interface name
ifconfig br-lan 192.168.122.10
ifconfig br-lan
```

You can now access the OpenWRT web interface on that IP.

### ARM
You can either use the process for x86_64, or the Raspberry Pi Imager. Make sure you get all the ethernet drivers for your platform.
You can check the chip on the ethernet / wifi card to find the manufacturer.
For smaller, embedded systems it's best not to install too many drivers as they take space.
For systems with a lot of resources (>2GB storage, >2GB memory, >2 cores) it doesn't matter.

```plaintext title="Drivers I use"
opkg install kmod-iwlwifi
opkg install iwlwifi-firmware
opkg install wpad
opkg install kmod-rtl8xxxu
opkg install kmod-r8169
```

## Upgrading OpenWRT
:::danger
When upgrading, don't forget to install drivers and any DNS packages!
:::

Use the [firmware selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/) to customize your upgrade. For example, I need the extra drivers,
the https-dns-proxy package, the cloudflare tunnel, an adblocker, and some tools to resize the filesystem.

```plaintext title="so I add the following packages"
https-dns-proxy luci-app-https-dns-proxy kmod-r8169 cloudflared luci-app-cloudflared adblock luci-app-adblock cfdisk resize2fs tune2fs
```

## Managing your router

### Change local IP pool
If you want to change the default IP range of your LAN interface, edit the `network` file in your config:
```plaintext title="/etc/config/network"
config interface 'lan'
	option device 'br-lan'
	option proto 'static'
	option ipaddr '192.168.2.3'
	option netmask '255.255.255.0'
	option ip6assign '60'
```
And then restart the network service:
```bash
service network restart
```
:::info
When doing changes to your local IP pool, remember to release and renew the IP address on your computer(s).
Make sure when setting up the DHCP server to lower the lease time to 1 or 2 minutes.

Usually, releasing and renewing IPs happens on clients:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
        ```plaintext
        ipconfig /release
        ipconfig /renew
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>
        On Mac, go to ```System Settings > Network > LAN Device > Details… > TCP/IP > Renew DHCP Lease```.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
        ```plaintext
        dhcpclient -r
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

### Resizing Filesystem
When installing OpenWRT on embedded systems (ARM) you will probably come across a problem where the OS is not utilizing all the storage on your drive.
For my case, I run OpenWRT on a Raspberry Pi 5. Installing the OS from Rapsberry Pi Imager uses only 100MB of storage. First we need to edit the `cmdline.txt`
in the boot folder. You need to do that right after you flash OpenWRT with Rapsberry Pi Imager, while the SD or disk is still on your other computer:
```bash title="/boot/cmdline.txt"
# THIS
root=PARTUUID=661a1cf7-02

# REPLACE WITH THIS
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2
```

Boot into OpenWRT and SSH into the system:
```bash title="Download the script and make it executable"
wget -U "" -O expand-root.sh "https://openwrt.org/_export/code/docs/guide-user/advanced/expand_root?codeblock=0"
chmod +x expand-root.sh

# Then run the script
./expand-root.sh
```

Reboot your system. It will probably reboot a couple of times. I also recommend having a screen hooked up (if possible) to monitor the bootstrap of the router.

### 802.1q VLAN

802.1q or dot1q is a standard in networking, specifically defining VLANs.
It is used to segregate a local network. A switch (that supports dot1q) can split frames into two or more VLANs.

Openwrt can either directly split up a network if it has enough physical ports, or through a trunk port.
A trunk port (or tagged port) is one physical port that can manage traffic on several VLANs.
For example, a router has only one physical LAN port, and the network devices are connected to
managed switch that supports 802.1q VLAN. Splitting the network happens inside the switch,
and the openwrt just manages and forwards the traffic accordingly.

### SNMP

SNMP (Simple Network Monitor Protocol) is a standard for monitoring your router. It is used to collect information about network devices, specifically the router. There are several packages you can use, but the documentation is rather sparse.
I found out that ```mini-snmpd``` is the simplest and fastest to setup. Download and install the package:

```bash
opkg update
opkg install mini_snmpd
```

Then edit the ```/etc/config/mini_snmpd``` configuration file:
```bash title="/etc/config/mini_config"
config mini_snmpd 'default'
	option enabled 1
	option ipv6 0
	# Verbose flag given to mini_snmpd, extra verbose is only possible with compile time config flags
	option debug 0
	# Turn on community authentication (snmp agent must use community name)
	option auth 0
	option community 'public' #This doubles as a password, so if your snmp server is public make this more secure
	option description 'My Router'
	option contact 'me  <me@hello.com>'
	option location 'Sweden'
	# to listen on all interfaces you need to set option listen_interface ''
	option listen_interface ''
	#option udp_port '161'
	#option tcp_port '161'
	#option vendor_oid ''
	option mib_timeout 1
	# enable basic disk usage statistics on specified mountpoint
	list disks '/overlay'
	list disks '/tmp'
	# enable basic network statistics on specified interface
	# 4 interfaces maximum per instance, as named in /etc/config/network and luci
	# not physical device names
	list interfaces 'lan'
	list interfaces 'wan'
```

Make sure everything is correct, and then start the service:
```bash
/etc/init.d/mini_snmpd start
```

To check that the service is actually working, use ```snmpwalk``` from another machine to inspect the snmp data. You might need to install ```snmp``` package first:

```bash
apt install snmp
pacman -S net-snmp
dnf install net-snmp net-snmp-utils
```
And then run:
```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.0.1 # Replace with your router IP address
```

You can then use the values to monitor and track your router. Check out [this](/docs/home#monitor-network-traffic) on how to monitor your network traffic from Home Assistant. It will be useful to also install a MIB file.
This will show what each OID corresponds to, and you don't have to guess what each number is.


## DNS
:::tip
If anything is broken, it's probably the DNS; start troubleshooting it first.
:::

### Custom DNS Server

There are two methods to use custom DNS server.
- Using a custom DNS for a WAN interface:
```
Network > Interfaces > wan interface > Edit > Advance Settings > Custom DNS
```
You can also force this DNS server by disabling the ```Use advertised DNS by peer``` setting.

- or DNS Forwarding:
```
Network > DHCP and DNS > Forwards > DNS Forwarding
```

### DNS Hijacking

You can configure your router to intercept all DNS traffic on your local network.

Navigate to **LuCI → Network → Firewall → Port Forwards**.

Click **Add** and specify:

1.  Name: `Intercept-DNS`
2.  Restrict to address family: IPv4 and IPv6
3.  Protocol: TCP, UDP
4.  Source zone: `lan`
5.  External port: `53`
6.  Destination zone: unspecified
7.  Internal IP address: any
8.  Internal port: any

Click **Save**, then **Save & Apply**.

You can find more info [here](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/firewall/fw3_configurations/intercept_dns).

### DNS Encryption
You can encrypt your DNS traffic by sending it over HTTPS (or TLS). The traffic is still routed using UDP for transport,
but the payload uses the HTTPS protocol. On Openwrt, you can install the ```dns-https-proxy``` and ```luci-app-dns-https-proxy```
and start forwarding your DNS traffic HTTPS.
:::warning
When upgrading, remember to reinstall this package or disable before upgrading;
it leaves dnsmasq settings that will be hard to reset without the package.
:::

### DDNS with Cloudflare
Dynanmic DNS helps you keep track of your IP and hook it to a domain name automatically. You will either need to use a service,
or find a domain registrar that has an API. I use Cloudflare, which has an API.

Go to your Cloudflare account page, Manage Account, Account API Tokens. Create and new custom API token,
add the Permissions "Zone" - "Zone" - "Read" and "Zone" - "DNS" - "Write". Include the domain name that will hook to your IP, save and keep the token.

You will need the following packages installed in OpenWRT:
```bash
ddns-scripts
ddns-scripts-cloudflare
ddns-scripts-services
luci-app-ddns
```

Refresh LuCi and go to Services > DDNS. Edit myddns_ipv4 and select from the DDNS service providers `cloudflare.com-v4`.
Set the rest as:
- **Enabled** - true
- **Lookup Hostname** - yourdomain.com (for a subdomain: sub.yourdomain.com)
- **Domain** - yourdomain.com (for a subdomain: sub@yourdomain.com)
- **Username** - Bearer
- **Password** - YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
- **Use HTTP Secure** - true
- **Path to CA Certificate** - /etc/ssl/certs

Save everything and refresh. Unfortunately, your ISP rotates your public IP automatically, so there is no way to test this other than waiting for the next rotation.
For me, sometimes I get a new public IP if I restart the router or if I unplug and then plug again the WAN interface.
